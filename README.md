## Task Notes

I have used sail in order to install mysql image to be attached to the project

I am a mac user so I had to do this and connect to the database using table plus

In order to connect the project change the DB_HOST variable to mysql but for migrations use 127.0.0.1

I have used the bootstrap laravel ui

I have included the front end task inside the project with route form

I included the tasks crud operations inside the project with the route tasks

You can user the build in authentication routes to test the extra field "las name" for registered users
